# oric atmos


*a personal favourite of our curator, the oric atmos is one of those machines that came and went in a blink of an eye.  but yet, here we are .. 2019 .. and there are still titles being written for this cute little machine, quirks and all. here we delight in seeing just how far things have come, 30 years after this short-lived machines demise on the mainstream market..*

# demo

turn the machine on, and follow the instructions.
