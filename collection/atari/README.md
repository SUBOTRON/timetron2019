# atari portfolio


*the atari portfolio was one of the first pocketable computers that you could actually use to do things .. famous as the hacker terminal used to collect cash from an ATM machine to defeat the Terminator, the portfolio fits in a special place in nerd lore.  unattainable - atari folded shortly after its release - yet desired as an object which showed us an alternative future - where atari still lived, and was as useful a tool against oppression as any toy of the rebellion.*

# demo

turn the machine on, and follow the instructions.
