## Vetus COMPUTERS non mori do suo USERS

*here we present a collection of archaic and interesting computers - the kind that just don't get used any more - doing interesting and modern things.  did you know there are still programmers releasing interesting and entertaining apps for your parents computers?  you know the ones, up in the closet somewhere.  still operational.  still just as fun as ever.  computers for which the only walled garden is the willpower to plug it in and boot it up.  its 2019, lets see what these old machines are still capable of doing.  and while we're at it, lets explore some of the systems that didn't make it into the mainstream - if but for a moment in an alternative universe, there was a chance we could all be running BeOS on our macbooks - lets find out what that would have been like.  or maybe we can use a dinosaur to find dinosaurs, and relive the excitement of SGI before it all changed and the world became iAddicted.*
