## Vetus COMPUTERS non mori do suo USERS

*„TIMETRON 2019 - interactive computer exhibit“

Old computers never die - their users do!  

SUBOTRON presents excerpts of the home computer collection of Jay Vaughan. These archaic machines don't get used any more but still do modern things. Did you know there are programmers releasing interesting and entertaining apps for your parents computers? Let´s see what these old machines are still capable of doing and explore some of the systems that didn't make it into the mainstream. Let´s find out what it would have been like to run alternative operating systems. We can use a dinosaur to find dinosaurs and relive the excitement of Silicon Graphics before it all changed and the world became iAddicted. The setting of playable computers in the ongoing exhibition is changing continuously.
TIMETRON 2019 brings old computers to new users in playful ways.
